# Test the Use of CSV Tables in Pandoc

This repository tests the differences between [baig/pandoc-csv2table: A Pandoc filter that renders CSV as Pandoc Markdown Tables.](https://github.com/baig/pandoc-csv2table) and [mb21/pandoc-placetable: Pandoc filter to include CSV data (from file or URL)](https://github.com/mb21/pandoc-placetable).

The source `.csv` files are from [baig/pandoc-csv2table/Examples/csv](https://github.com/baig/pandoc-csv2table/tree/master/Examples/csv).

This probably is a temporary repository that will be deleted once the tests finish.
